# Numerical Methods ðŸ“˜ðŸ’»  

This repository is a space for learning and experimenting with numerical methods. The main goal is to study and implement various numerical algorithms, following the approach of *Numerical Analysis* by Burden and Faires.  

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives  
- Write a theoretical explanation for each method.  
- Implement the algorithms in code.  
- Explore examples and applications.  

## ðŸ“– Contents  
The repository will include methods for:  
âœ” Solving nonlinear equations  
âœ” Interpolation and approximation  
âœ” Numerical differentiation and integration  
âœ” Solving systems of linear equations  
âœ” Differential equations  

## ðŸš€ Project Status  
This is a work in progress and primarily a self-learning project. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome.
